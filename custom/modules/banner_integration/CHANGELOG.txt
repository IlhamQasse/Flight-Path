Banner Integration 4.x CHANGELOG
--------------------------------

------------------
RELEASED 1.0-beta9
------------------


2015-05-15
  Added simple caching to two functions, which might help speed up routines.
  

2015-03-12
  Added support for "level code", requires FlightPath version 4.7.1 or higher.
  

------------------
RELEASED 1.0-beta8
------------------


2014-06-24
  Adjusted the transfer_eqv_global routine to look for other sources of transfer_hours if it reads
  zero, which might indicate an error.
  

------------------
RELEASED 1.0-beta7
------------------

2014-06-20
  Added routine to populate transfer_eqv_global table which comes with the transfer_search module.
  

------------------
RELEASED 1.0-beta6
------------------

2014-03-19
  Added extra code to hook_student_load, to re-run the calculate_cumulative_hours_and_gpa function,
  if that option is set in the system settings.
  
  This module now requires at least version 4.4.1 of FlightPath.


------------------
RELEASED 1.0-beta5
------------------

2014-03-17
  Added ability to set what the "enrolled grade" is, when loading local courses from Banner.
  It had previously been hard-coded to "E".


------------------
RELEASED 1.0-beta4
------------------


2014-03-13
  Changed the way the transfer courses routine works, so that if an eqv is specified (but the local
  course doesn't exist), the row isn't skipped.  Instead it gets saved normally, just missing its eqv.


------------------
RELEASED 1.0-beta3
------------------


2013-11-20
  Added a field to the query for student transfer courses, to also look for academic renewal
  codes which means it should be skipped. This is an "E" by default, but is configurable on the settings
  page.


------------------
RELEASED 1.0-beta2
------------------
  


2013-11-05
  Made the shrtckn_repeat_course_ind code a setting the user can change (or not use), 
  instead of permanently set to "E".
  

2013-10-23
  Added "shrtckn_repeat_course_ind" to the fields that get returned from our historical query of student's
  courses.  If the field is "E" (for "exclude") then the course will be skipped.
  

2013-08-07
  Modified import_student_transfer_courses routine to combine "split up" transfer credits into
  a single record in the student_transfer_courses table, as is required by FP.  This is to fix a bug.


2013-07-26
  Fixed bug in import_students routine, where for new students the correct row wasn't necessarily being
  pulled from Banner.
  

------------------
RELEASED 1.0-beta1
------------------
  

2013-07-25
  Fixed a bug in the import_students routine, where students were not being updated if they already
  existed in the users table.
  
  Added an import_faculty_staff routine.
  
  Added a simple change to the routines functions for import_students and import_faculty_staff
  where you can say if you want to populate/truncate the goremal scratch able.  That's because
  they both use that scratch table, so if you are running both routines, you don't want to
  needlessly re-populate the table.
  

2013-07-24
  Updated ...import_students routine again, as well as the scratch table, to look at the
  stst_code (should be AS) to determine if a student is 'active' or not.
  

2013-07-22
  Modified the ...import_students routine to look at term_code_admit, as well as registered_ind
  and enrolled_ind, in determining if a student was "active" or not.  Modified the scratch table
  to include that field as well.
  
  Modified hook_update to just always recreate scratch tables every time we update.
  
  

2013-07-19
  In the interest of speeding up the import_students routine, I am creating a new scratch table,
  goremal, for keeping up with email addresses.
  
  Added lots of watchdog logging entries to the routines.
  
  Modified the transfer courses routine, to write to temp tables first, then copy to real tables
  at the end, as its safer to do that, should Banner die in the middle of that long function.
  

2013-07-18
  Added the ...import_local_courses routine, which will import university courses (subject_id,
  course_num, hours, titles) from Banner into FP's database.  Be sure before running that
  you configure the settings on the admin config form!
  

2013-07-17
  Added the ...import_student_transfer_courses routine, which loads all students' transfer
  credits and eqv's from Banner, and adds them to the MySQL database.  It is meant to be run
  nightly, along with the other routines.
  
  Added a new hook, to allow modification to a record being read from the transfer routine.


2013-07-13
  Changed function ...current_term()  to ...get_current_term_details, to better reflect the
  fact that it returns an array of details about the current term, not just the term code itself.
  
  Updated the ..get_student_local_courses to fix bug associated with getting the current term.
  
  Added ...import_student_users function to the routines.inc file.
  
  Create scratch table in .install file.
  
  Updated .info file to use new schema.
    

2013-07-12
  Updated routines queries not to die on oracle errors, but instead to allow the latest
  version of oracleapi module handle that for us.


2013-07-09
  Now loads local student courses automatically.  Make sure to enable that on this module's settings
  page.  Does this by implementing hook_student_load.

  Added import_advisor_student() function to the routines.inc file, and updated the sample_routine.php.txt
  file to reflect that.
  

2013-07-08
  Initial release of module, in very alpha stage.
