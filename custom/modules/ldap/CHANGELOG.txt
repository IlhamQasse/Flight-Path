Changelog for LDAP module (4.x)
===============================

---------------------------
RELEASED VERSION 1.0-beta6
---------------------------

2015-06-09
  Fixed bug in LDAP login procedure, as well as allowed for my diverse types of LDAP setups.

  Removed constraint that CWIDs must be numeric.
  
2015-05-21
  Added ability to test for LDAP attributes, even if they do not follow the field[0] structure.
  In practical terms, this means you can test for "dn" as a field, when testing if a user is student or faculty.

2014-02-07
  Added is_active flag to the student's table, when a student logs in.

2014-02-06
  Added additional operators to the settings field, where we destermine if a user is
  a student or a faculty member.  Added "is numeric" and "is blank".
  
  Added ability to hook in for the user type determination.  See README.txt file for
  more details on how the hook works.
  
  Added extra documentation to the settings form, to make it obvious that users may need
  to make all their fieldnames lowercase, regardless of how it appears in LDAP.  This
  is a limitation in PHP.


2013-12-03
  Added ability to specify more than one LDAP server, for the purposes of a simple
  load balancer.  The module will select one of the addresses at random, if a second
  address is specified.


2013-03-13

  Added some extra verbage to the settings form, to make options clearer.
  
  Added README.txt file.
